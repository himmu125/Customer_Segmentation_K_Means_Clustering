Description of the code : Libraries used : numpy, pandas, sklearn, matplotlib.pyplot and seaborn

1. Data Collection and Cleaning
2. Choosing number of clusters with WCSS
3. Plotting an Elbow Point graph
4. Training K-Means Clustetring model with optimum number of clusters
5. Visualizing all the clusters

Thank You
